### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Great job planning and hitting an achievable scope for this project! Good use of user stories, and planning the questions and answers ahead of time. As we start working on larger applications in the future, it would be nice to include more evidence of your planning process, such as wireframes, ERD's, a Trello board, etc. Also, would take the time to make the `readme` your own and relevant to the project.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! You clearly identified the problem and came up with a functional game in less than 100 lines of code, pretty sweet! I really like your creativity with the design, and overall layout!

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Leaning toward "Exceeds" here because your code is so clean. Please review my inline code comments [here](https://github.com/mohamedrchalal/DeadpoolTrivia/compare/gh-pages...nolds9:feedback) (prefixed with my initials - "NHO") for suggestions. Moving forward, I would encourage you to start leaving code comments, work on breaking code into semantic blocks, and taking an object-oriented approach.

* __Problem Solving__:

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Nice work on this project! It looks like you had fun with this one, and made it your own. I would really like to see you come back to this and implement your wish-list features.
